{text:"Two organisms A and B are identical in all ways except organism A has cells with a surface area to volume ratio of 10:1 while organism B has cells with a ratio of 2:1. Which organism can rely more heavily on simple diffusion for nutrient and gas exchange at the cellular level and why?",options:["Organism B because larger cells always diffuse substances more efficiently","Organism A because its high surface area relative to volume means a greater proportion of the cell interior is within easy diffusion distance of the cell surface allowing faster exchange of substances","Both organisms rely equally on diffusion because diffusion rate depends only on concentration gradient","Neither organism can use diffusion because both are multicellular"],correct:1},
{text:"If the cellulose cell wall of plant cells were suddenly replaced by a membrane as flexible as the animal cell membrane what would be the most critical immediate consequence for plant structure?",options:["Plants would photosynthesize more efficiently because light could enter cells more easily","Plants would immediately lose turgor pressure and structural rigidity because the flexible membrane cannot resist the inward pressure of water entering by osmosis causing cells to swell and burst like animal cells in hypotonic solution","Plants would grow taller because the rigid wall no longer limits cell expansion","Plants would lose the ability to perform photosynthesis"],correct:1},
{text:"A researcher claims that active transport is fundamentally wasteful because it uses energy to move substances that could move by diffusion if given enough time. Under what biological circumstance is this claim most comprehensively wrong?",options:["When the substance is moving from high to low concentration anyway","When a substance must be concentrated to levels hundreds of times higher than the surrounding medium as in the reabsorption of glucose from kidney tubules or absorption of ions from very dilute soil solution where diffusion would move the substance in the wrong direction indefinitely","When the temperature is very high and diffusion is already fast","When the cell is resting and not performing any active functions"],correct:1},
{text:"Consider an organism whose cells lack a vacuole. What functional consequence would this have specifically for the organism's ability to regulate its internal water balance?",options:["No consequence because vacuoles are only found in plant cells and have no role in water balance","The organism would lose a key compartment for storing water and maintaining turgor pressure meaning it could not build up osmotic pressure to draw water in during dry conditions or release excess water during flooding","The organism would photosynthesize more efficiently because vacuoles block light","The organism would become immune to osmotic stress"],correct:1},
{text:"A student observes that cells near the surface of a multicellular organism receive adequate oxygen by diffusion alone while cells deep inside the organism cannot survive by diffusion alone. What does this observation reveal about why complex multicellular organisms require specialised transport systems?",options:["Deep cells are always dead and non-functional in all organisms","As organisms become larger the distance from the surface to internal cells exceeds the effective range of diffusion so dedicated transport systems such as blood circulation are required to deliver oxygen and nutrients to cells too far from the surface to be supplied by diffusion","Deep cells use photosynthesis instead of respiration to avoid needing oxygen","Specialised transport systems evolved only in aquatic organisms"],correct:1},
{text:"If a mutation caused all mitochondria in a muscle cell to produce only half the normal amount of ATP what cascade of physiological effects would follow in sequence?",options:["The muscle cell would immediately divide to compensate for reduced energy","ATP production falls leading to reduced active transport efficiency then reduced ability to maintain ion gradients then impaired action potential propagation then reduced muscle contraction force ultimately causing muscle weakness","Only the speed of protein synthesis would be reduced with no effect on contraction","The muscle cell would switch to using sunlight as an alternative energy source"],correct:1},
{text:"The concentration of haemoglobin inside a red blood cell is far higher than in the surrounding blood plasma. This concentration difference is maintained against the osmotic tendency of water to enter the cell. What process must be continuously operating to prevent the cell from bursting?",options:["Photosynthesis inside the red blood cell generates energy to balance the osmotic pressure","Active transport of ions such as sodium and potassium across the red blood cell membrane continuously adjusts the internal osmotic environment maintaining cell volume and preventing osmotic lysis","Diffusion of haemoglobin out of the cell reduces the internal concentration to match plasma","The red blood cell wall prevents any osmotic water movement"],correct:1},
{text:"A student argues that because diffusion requires no energy it is always the most efficient strategy for cells to move substances. Construct the strongest possible counterargument using biological principles.",options:["The student is completely correct and there is no valid counterargument","Efficiency cannot be measured by energy use alone: diffusion is inadequate when substances must be moved against their concentration gradient when speed of uptake is essential for cell survival or when substances must be concentrated to levels far exceeding surrounding fluid making active transport not wasteful but necessary for life","All cells use active transport not diffusion so the student is factually wrong","Diffusion is only used by plant cells not animal cells"],correct:1},
{text:"Two species of bacteria are found in the same lake. Species X thrives in freshwater conditions while species Y thrives only in salty water. If species X is transferred to the salty water what osmotic event would most likely kill it?",options:["Species X would absorb salt and become hypertonic thriving in the new environment","Water would leave species X cells by osmosis into the hypertonic salt water causing the cytoplasm to shrink away from the cell wall in plasmolysis-like shrinkage leading to cell death","Species X would burst because it cannot handle the additional pressure from salt","Species X would immediately evolve a salt-tolerant membrane"],correct:1},
{text:"In a scientific experiment cells are first treated with a drug that blocks all protein synthesis then observed over 48 hours. Which organelle-dependent processes would be most severely compromised over this time period?",options:["Osmosis and diffusion would stop immediately","Active transport would eventually fail as carrier proteins wear out and cannot be replaced and the cell membrane would degrade as phospholipid-associated proteins cannot be renewed ultimately destroying membrane integrity and all transport functions","DNA replication would stop but the cell would otherwise function normally","Only muscle contraction would be affected"],correct:1},
{text:"A student examines a photograph of two cells. Cell A is spherical and small with few mitochondria. Cell B is elongated with hundreds of mitochondria and long thin projections from its surface. Without knowing what type of cells these are what can be inferred about the function of cell B?",options:["Cell B is likely a storage cell because elongated cells always store materials","Cell B is likely highly metabolically active requiring large amounts of ATP possibly involved in active transport movement or rapid signalling given its many mitochondria and large surface area created by its projections","Cell B is likely a reproductive cell because elongated cells divide faster","Cell B is likely dead because healthy cells are always spherical"],correct:1},
{text:"Why would it be physiologically catastrophic for the concentration of salts in human blood plasma to suddenly double even if the total volume of blood remained unchanged?",options:["Double the salt concentration would cause all blood proteins to denature instantly","Red blood cells surrounded by now-hypertonic plasma would lose water by osmosis shrivel and be unable to carry oxygen while all other body cells would also lose water by osmosis disrupting their function causing widespread organ failure","Double salt concentration would only cause increased thirst with no other consequence","Blood would simply become saltier with no effect on cell function"],correct:1},
{text:"Consider a plant growing in soil with a very low mineral ion concentration. The plant needs these ions for protein synthesis and growth. The ions are at lower concentration in the soil than inside root cells. Which combination of cellular features would you expect to find in the root hair cells as a direct consequence of this challenge?",options:["Very few mitochondria because ion uptake is a passive process requiring no energy","Many mitochondria to generate ATP for active transport of ions against the concentration gradient and a large surface area from hair-like extensions to maximise contact with soil solution","Many chloroplasts because root hairs need to photosynthesise to absorb ions","Thick cell walls to prevent any ion movement"],correct:1},
{text:"A biologist proposes that the seven characteristics of life are not merely descriptive but that each is necessary for a system to be considered alive. Which characteristic if removed would most rapidly lead to the elimination of all others?",options:["Movement because without movement organisms cannot find food","Reproduction because without reproduction organisms cannot replace themselves but an individual organism could still live out its full lifespan performing all other life processes","Nutrition because without the intake of energy all other life processes including respiration growth excretion and reproduction require energy and would cease without a nutritional supply","Excretion because waste accumulates slowly"],correct:2},
{text:"If you could observe a cell in which the concentration of substances inside and outside were perfectly equal for every molecule what would happen to all three transport processes: diffusion osmosis and active transport?",options:["All three would stop completely because there would be no concentration gradients and no need for active transport either","Diffusion and osmosis would stop because no net gradients exist but active transport could still function if ATP were available however it would produce no net biological benefit since equal concentrations would be instantly re-equalised by diffusion","Diffusion and osmosis would speed up dramatically and active transport would stop","Only active transport would continue because it does not depend on gradients"],correct:1},
{text:"The genetic information in the nucleus directs the synthesis of proteins at ribosomes. If a mutation disrupted the structure of the nuclear membrane making it fully permeable rather than selectively permeable what cascade of problems would ensue?",options:["No problems would arise because the nucleus would still contain DNA","Regulatory molecules and proteins from the cytoplasm would freely enter the nucleus disrupting gene regulation and DNA replication while nuclear contents including transcription machinery would leak out ultimately causing uncontrolled or absent gene expression and cell death","Only the rate of protein synthesis would increase","The cell would immediately undergo meiosis"],correct:1},
{text:"A researcher compares the magnification needed to see different cellular components. Ribosomes require electron microscopy while mitochondria can sometimes be seen with high-powered light microscopes. What does this difference in required magnification reveal about the relative sizes of these two organelles?",options:["Both organelles are the same size but ribosomes are transparent to light","Ribosomes are far smaller than mitochondria falling below the resolving power of the light microscope while mitochondria are large enough to be at or just above this threshold demonstrating that organelle size spans several orders of magnitude","Light microscopes can see ribosomes if the correct stain is used","Mitochondria are smaller than ribosomes"],correct:1},
{text:"If the partially permeable membrane of a cell became fully permeable to all substances simultaneously what would be the immediate osmotic consequence?",options:["The cell would gain water rapidly from all directions and burst","All concentration gradients inside and outside the cell would equilibrate by free diffusion eliminating the basis for osmosis and active transport so no further selective movement could occur causing the cell to lose all ability to regulate its internal composition leading to death","The cell would become immune to osmotic stress","Active transport would immediately compensate by pumping substances back"],correct:1},
{text:"A tissue engineer is trying to grow replacement muscle tissue in a laboratory. She finds the lab-grown muscle cells contract weakly. She measures and finds these cells have 30% fewer mitochondria than normal muscle cells. What is the most mechanistically direct explanation for the weak contraction?",options:["Fewer mitochondria means fewer ribosomes which means less actin and myosin produced","Fewer mitochondria means reduced ATP production from cellular respiration providing less energy for the actin-myosin cross-bridge cycling mechanism that drives contraction resulting in weaker force generation","Fewer mitochondria alter the cell's membrane potential preventing nerve signals from reaching the muscle","Mitochondria directly generate the mechanical force of contraction so fewer means less force"],correct:1},
{text:"A student proposes that multicellular organisms evolved from unicellular organisms primarily because being large offers protection from predators. A biologist counters that multicellularity also solved a fundamental physiological problem. What is that fundamental physiological problem?",options:["Unicellular organisms cannot reproduce sexually","As body size increases the surface area to volume ratio decreases making diffusion alone insufficient to supply all cells with nutrients and remove waste creating the need for specialised cells tissues and internal transport systems","Unicellular organisms cannot synthesise proteins","Multicellularity evolved to allow organisms to photosynthesise"],correct:1},
{text:"Consider the following observation: when iodine is added to a cross-section of a potato the outer layers turn blue-black immediately while the cells deep inside show the colour change only after several minutes. What does this time delay most likely reveal about diffusion in solid tissue?",options:["The inner cells produce more starch than outer cells causing a slower reaction","The diffusion of iodine molecules through the tissue takes time because diffusion is a relatively slow process over longer distances confirming that diffusion rate decreases as distance increases","The inner cells have thicker cell walls blocking iodine","The time delay is due to a chemical reaction not diffusion"],correct:1},
{text:"A scientist working on a new cancer treatment wants to selectively destroy rapidly dividing cells without harming non-dividing cells. Which cellular process would be the best target and why?",options:["Osmosis because cancer cells perform more osmosis than normal cells","DNA replication because rapidly dividing cells must continuously copy their DNA while non-dividing cells have already replicated and are not actively replicating making this process a more selective target in dividing cells","Active transport because cancer cells absorb more glucose by active transport","Diffusion because oxygen diffuses faster into cancer cells"],correct:1},
{text:"Two students observe red blood cells in different solutions. Student A's cells are normal biconcave discs. Student B's cells have all become spherical and swollen. Without being told which solution was used what can Student B's observation tell us about the solution her cells were placed in?",options:["The solution was hypertonic causing water to leave the cells and shrink them","The solution was hypotonic meaning it had a lower solute concentration than the cell cytoplasm causing water to enter the cells by osmosis making them swell into spherical shapes","The solution was isotonic and the cells grew naturally","The solution contained a drug that changed cell shape"],correct:1},
{text:"Why is it biologically significant that the myelin sheath surrounding nerve axons is composed primarily of lipid rather than protein or carbohydrate?",options:["Lipids are cheaper for the body to produce than proteins","Lipids are electrically insulating materials that prevent ion flow across the axon membrane between nodes which forces the nerve impulse to jump rapidly from node to node greatly increasing conduction speed compared to an unmyelinated fibre","Lipids provide structural support to prevent the axon from bending","Lipids are water-soluble allowing nutrients to pass through the sheath easily"],correct:1},
{text:"If two adjacent plant cells have different internal solute concentrations will water move between them by osmosis even without an external solution and in which direction?",options:["No because osmosis only occurs when cells are placed in external solutions","Yes water will move by osmosis from the cell with lower internal solute concentration (higher water concentration) to the cell with higher internal solute concentration (lower water concentration) through the shared partially permeable membranes even without an external solution","Water moves from the more concentrated cell to the less concentrated cell","No because cell walls prevent osmosis between adjacent cells"],correct:1},
{text:"A biologist is designing an artificial cell membrane for drug delivery. She wants it to allow small molecules in by diffusion but require active transport for large molecules. What membrane properties must she engineer to achieve both criteria simultaneously?",options:["The membrane must be completely impermeable to all substances","The membrane must be partially permeable with pores sized to allow small molecule diffusion while embedding carrier proteins powered by an energy source such as ATP to transport large molecules selectively against gradients","The membrane must be fully permeable to ensure large molecules can enter","She cannot achieve both properties simultaneously in a single membrane"],correct:1},
{text:"The process of photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose while cellular respiration releases that chemical energy as ATP. In what fundamental way is ATP a better energy currency than glucose for direct use in cellular processes?",options:["ATP contains more energy per molecule than glucose","ATP releases its energy in small controlled increments when a single phosphate bond is hydrolysed making it suitable for powering individual molecular events like active transport or muscle contraction without releasing all energy at once as heat unlike the complete oxidation of glucose","Glucose cannot be broken down by cells so ATP must be made first","ATP is water-soluble while glucose is not making ATP easier to transport"],correct:1},
{text:"A student claims that all cells in a multicellular organism have the same DNA but different functions. A second student says this is impossible because if they have the same DNA they must make the same proteins. How is the first student's claim possible?",options:["The first student is wrong: different cells have different DNA","Through differential gene expression: all cells contain the complete genome but only a subset of genes are activated in any given cell type creating different patterns of protein production that result in different structures and functions while the underlying DNA sequence is identical in all cells","All cells do make the same proteins but in different locations","Cells in different tissues have slightly mutated versions of the original DNA"],correct:1},
{text:"If you placed a limp wilted piece of celery in pure water for one hour it would become firm and crisp again. If you then placed the same crisp celery stick in a very concentrated salt solution it would become limp again. What would happen if you alternated this treatment ten times and why?",options:["The celery would eventually burst from repeated water entry","The celery would become firm in water (cells become turgid as water enters by osmosis) and limp in salt solution (cells lose water by osmosis becoming flaccid) each time and this would cycle repeatedly as long as the cell membranes remain intact because osmosis is reversible and driven entirely by the water concentration gradient","After two cycles the cell membranes would become permanently permeable and osmosis would stop","The celery would absorb salt permanently after the first salt treatment and never become turgid again"],correct:1},
{text:"A student studying a slide of an unknown tissue notices the cells are arranged in a single flat layer with a very thin profile and no visible organelles under the light microscope. Based purely on structural reasoning what function is this tissue most likely performing?",options:["Active secretion of enzymes because secretory cells are always flat","Rapid diffusion of substances across the tissue because the thin single-layer arrangement with large surface area and minimal diffusion distance is structurally optimised for passive transport of substances from one side to the other","High-energy mechanical contraction because thin cells contract more efficiently","Structural support because flat cells provide the strongest support"],correct:1},
{text:"Consider a scenario where a cell's respiration rate doubles but its membrane surface area and carrier protein density remain unchanged. What would be the effect on the maximum rate of active transport?",options:["Active transport would also double because twice the ATP is available","The maximum active transport rate would NOT double despite doubled ATP because the rate is also limited by the number of available carrier proteins: with fixed carrier density all carriers would eventually be saturated and additional ATP would provide no further increase in maximum transport rate","Active transport would increase indefinitely as long as ATP is available","Doubled respiration would actually reduce active transport by producing too much CO2"],correct:1},
{text:"A scientist claims she can determine whether a cell is a plant cell or an animal cell using only osmosis without looking at it under a microscope. How could she do this?",options:["She cannot determine cell type using osmosis alone","She could place the cell in progressively more dilute solutions: a plant cell would resist bursting because its rigid cellulose cell wall prevents unlimited water entry and provides turgor pressure while an animal cell without a cell wall would swell and burst in pure water or a sufficiently hypotonic solution revealing its type by its behaviour","She would need to stain the cell first to make osmosis work","Both cell types would burst at exactly the same solute concentration"],correct:1},
{text:"The textbook describes that some sharks can sense one part blood in 10 or even 100 million parts of seawater. Thinking purely about diffusion principles what must be true about the concentration gradient and the distance over which diffusion operates to make this detection possible?",options:["Diffusion of blood molecules cannot travel more than a few centimetres","For detection at extreme dilutions the gradient from the source must remain detectable over a large distance which means the shark's sensory cells must be extraordinarily sensitive to extremely small concentration differences and the diffusion of odour molecules through seawater must operate over distances of many metres","Blood molecules do not diffuse in salt water so sharks must swim directly to the source","The shark uses active transport not diffusion to detect blood"],correct:1},
{text:"A biologist argues that the discovery of the electron microscope in the 1930s was as important to biology as the invention of the light microscope in the 1600s. What is the strongest biological justification for this comparison?",options:["Both microscopes work on identical principles and produce identical images","Just as the light microscope revealed the cellular basis of life opening the era of cell biology the electron microscope revealed the ultrastructure of organelles and enabled the discovery of subcellular structures such as ribosomes and the detailed architecture of mitochondria that are invisible to light microscopy transforming molecular and cell biology","The electron microscope simply provided a cleaner version of what the light microscope had already shown","The electron microscope was important only for material science not biology"],correct:1},
{text:"A student proposes that organisms do not need kidneys if they live in isotonic environments because no osmotic stress would occur. Evaluate this reasoning.",options:["The student is completely correct: isotonic organisms never face osmotic stress","The reasoning is flawed because even in isotonic conditions metabolic waste products such as urea are continuously produced and accumulate inside cells creating a need for excretory organs to remove toxic metabolites regardless of the osmotic environment","Kidneys only function in hypertonic environments","All aquatic organisms live in isotonic environments and none of them have kidneys"],correct:1},
{text:"If the process of differentiation were reversed in a mature specialised cell such as a liver cell returning it to a stem cell state what would be the immediate consequence at the tissue and organ level?",options:["The liver would immediately regenerate all lost functions","The liver cell would lose its specific enzymatic and metabolic functions such as detoxification and protein synthesis meaning that enough de-differentiation events would progressively impair liver function as specialised cells are replaced by undifferentiated ones unable to perform hepatic tasks","The cell would immediately divide and produce more liver cells","Differentiation reversal has no consequence for organ function"],correct:1},
{text:"Two molecules X and Y are both needed by a cell. Molecule X is always in higher concentration outside the cell than inside. Molecule Y is always in higher concentration inside the cell than outside. Which transport mechanism would be appropriate for each and what would happen if the cell's oxygen supply were cut off?",options:["Both molecules need active transport and cutting oxygen would have no effect","Molecule X can enter by diffusion down its concentration gradient while molecule Y requires active transport to be maintained at high internal concentration against its gradient: cutting oxygen would halt respiration reduce ATP and impair active transport of Y causing its internal concentration to fall as it diffuses out","Both molecules use only osmosis and oxygen is irrelevant","Molecule X uses active transport and molecule Y uses osmosis"],correct:1},
{text:"A researcher proposes that because the human body replaces most cells every few years we should be able to fully recover from any disease given enough time without treatment. What fundamental biological flaw makes this reasoning incorrect for many diseases?",options:["The body actually never replaces any cells after birth","Many diseases are caused by pathogens that actively damage cells faster than they can be replaced or by genetic mutations that cause replacement cells to be equally dysfunctional or by destruction of cell types such as certain neurons that have little or no capacity for self-replacement making natural recovery impossible without intervention","This reasoning is entirely correct and medicine is unnecessary","The body can only replace skin cells not internal organ cells"],correct:1},
{text:"Consider a scenario in which all starch in a cell is suddenly converted to cellulose. What would be the immediate metabolic consequence for the cell?",options:["The cell would gain extra structural rigidity from increased cellulose and function normally","The cell would lose its carbohydrate energy reserve because cellulose cannot be broken down by animal or plant cells own enzymes to release glucose for respiration leaving the cell unable to generate ATP from its stored carbohydrate","The cell would immediately begin photosynthesising more rapidly to compensate","Cellulose and starch have identical energy content so no metabolic change would occur"],correct:1},
{text:"A scientist notes that increasing the concentration gradient across a membrane increases the rate of diffusion but increasing the concentration gradient has no effect on the maximum rate of active transport beyond a certain point. What structural explanation accounts for this difference in behaviour?",options:["Active transport requires more ATP at higher concentrations limiting its speed","Diffusion rate is limited only by the gradient and random particle movement and can increase indefinitely with gradient while active transport is limited by the number of carrier proteins available: once all carriers are saturated additional gradient increase cannot raise the rate beyond this saturation maximum","Active transport does not use concentration gradients at all so this comparison is invalid","Diffusion also reaches a maximum rate at high concentrations for the same reason"],correct:1},
{text:"If a unicellular organism and a multicellular organism of the same mass are compared the unicellular organism relies entirely on diffusion for gas exchange while the multicellular organism requires a circulatory system. What single mathematical relationship between surface area and volume most concisely explains why this difference exists?",options:["Larger organisms have more surface area in absolute terms so diffusion is more efficient","As an organism increases in size its volume grows faster than its surface area causing the surface area to volume ratio to decrease meaning the surface is insufficient to exchange gases by diffusion alone for all the internal cells unlike a unicellular organism where every part of the cell is near the surface","Multicellular organisms are always denser than unicellular organisms requiring circulation","The surface area to volume ratio increases with size making diffusion less necessary in larger organisms"],correct:1}
